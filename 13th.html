				<p>That means trans-resveratrol is more easily absorbed by the body and can produce more beneficial effects.</p>

				<p>Thankfully, there’s a much better source for resveratrol — extracted from “Japanese Knotweed”.</p>

			<img class="question-line" src="assets\images\under-img.png">
		</div>

		<div class="question-content font1">
			<h5 class="wght1 size7">What is Resv-Rx?</h5>
			<p class="pd-top size6">It’s the most powerful nature’s super-nutrient — Trans-Resveratrol. Not only does it amplify the power of Bazopril but goes above and beyond heart health. It supports your entire body’s anti-aging at the cellular level. </p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">Which means it makes your cells healthier and supports cell turnover. It helps them survive longer. It also supports mitochondria — powerhouses of your cells. It also supports healthy aging so you can maintain a youthful appearance!</p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">It also helps support "old-age" health concerns — including cholesterol... memory... and blood sugar... just to name a few!</p>

			<h5 class="wght1 size7">How does Resv-Rx work?</h5>
			<p class="pd-top size6">It works by activating a group of proteins called sirtuins, which have been linked to longer life spans in studies. </p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">By activating these proteins, resveratrol can help protect your cells from damage, reduce inflammation in your body, and help your body better respond to stress. This all helps to promote healthy aging and potentially extend your life.</p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">Additionally, resveratrol has been found to lower the risk of blood clots, prevent the oxidation of LDL (bad) cholesterol, and inhibit platelet aggregation, all of which are beneficial for heart health.</p>

			<h5 class="wght1 size7">What makes Resv-Rx different from similar products?</h5>
			<p class="pd-top size6">There are two types of resveratrol — trans-resveratrol and cis resveratrol. Resv-Rx contains trans-resveratrol because it’s the most bioavailable and biologically active form that exists in nature. </p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">It’s derived from Japanese knotweed that contains 99% pure trans-resveratrol for the easiest absorption.</p>
			<p class="pd-top2 size6">The result? Increased energy, sharper memory, healthy eyes, healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels, enhanced joint comfort, and much more — all thanks to nature's most powerful molecule!</p>

			<h5 class="wght1 size7">How should I take Resv-Rx?</h5>
			<p class="pd-top size6">Take one capsule 20-30 minutes before a meal with a glass of water or your favorite beverage.</p>
